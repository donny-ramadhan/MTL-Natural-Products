# MTL Natural Products

This repository contains the KNIME workflow and Python codes required to reproduce the experiments described in the paper titled "Optimizing Multi-Task Learning with Evolutionary Relatedness Metrics for Enhanced QSAR-based Natural Product Activity Prediction."

The necessary data files are available on Google Drive:

```https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1I9CYtY2-fV14F_X3uQvO4BNXKCwu8szG?usp=sharing```

To set up the required packages, a virtual environment is created using the supplied mtl.yml file with the command:

```conda env create -f mtl.yml```

After the environment is successfully created, it can be activated with:

```conda activate mtl```
